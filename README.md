# ChemView
3D VR Interactive Modeling of Molecules.

Can provide any Chemical Markup (`.cml`) file to ChemView, and it will be able to plot this molecule in Blender for easy import into Unity.

Additionally, there is a Unity3D project in MoleculeUnityVR which can take `.cml` files and generate an interactive molecule in Unity with Steam VR.
